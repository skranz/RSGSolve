# RSGSolve
R Interface to Ben Brook's SGSolve package to solve stochastic games (see http://www.benjaminbrooks.net/software.shtml).

Unlike my dyngame package, this package solves stochastic games without assuming monetary transfers.

To install it, first install the `devtools` package in R and then type:
```r
devtools::install_github("skranz/RSGSolve")
```

For examples, take a look at the examples in my `dyngame` package that solves stochastic games with monetary transfers:
